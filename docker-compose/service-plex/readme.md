## 🌍 Installation 🌍

## ⚙️ Configuration ⚙️

### Remote Access - No Exposed Port

If using plex behind a reverse-proxy, then you want to disable remote access in plex. Let the proxy handle this for you.

Step 1: Plex > Server Settings > Click Show Advance.  
Step 2: Network > Custom server access URLs > Enter the address e.g. https://stream.contoso.com  
Step 3: Remote Access > Disable Remote Access.

### Remote Access - With Exposed Port

If the above mentioned is causing issues, you can always do things the ol' fashioned way by opening up the port on your service. To do this you would include the override compose file [service-plex.ports.compose.yml](service-plex.ports.compose.yml).

Then enable port forwarding on your router.  
Step 2 of _#Remote Access - No Exposed Port_ would still be beneficial.

### Hardware Transcoding

For hardware transcoding, you can include the override compose file [service-plex.nvidia.compose.yml](service-plex.nvidia.compose.yml).

For this to work, you would need to have the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) installed on the host machine.

TODO: Add guide for nvidia-container-toolkit installation and testing.
