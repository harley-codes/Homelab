# service-portainer

## 🌍 Installation 🌍

There is only one variable set in the docker compose file.

It can be set on the host, but for a more simple approach, you can run the **_compose up -d_** command with the variable piped through.

```bash
VAR_PROXY_HOST_ROUTE=this.contoso.com docker compose -p service-portainer -f service-portainer.compose.yml --env-file .env up -d
```
